## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why Would You Do This?
Great question! One of us saw a poster like this in New York a couple of weeks ago and thought that he too had access to free printing at a library. More seriously, we are two roommates who get along great and have not yet met the right people. This seemed like a fun way to do just that.

### Why a Double Date?
We are good friends and thought it would be fun to meet new people together. If you would prefer, feel free to request a date with just one of us in your email to <{{site.email}}>.

### Who Came Up With This Brilliant Idea?
Email us at <{{site.email}}> to find out!

### Are Any of These Questions Frequently Asked?
No idea, but we sure hope so! We are not big fans of web trackers, so frankly the only way we could know is if you email us your questions to <{{site.email}}>. Please do, even if you are not interested in getting to know us, we would love to hear your thoughts and comments!
